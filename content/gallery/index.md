When I design, I have to follow the four E's of design that I created:
1. Educate
2. Engage
3. Elevate
4. Elaborate

I believe that a design should not always be **static**. It could also be **dynamic**.

Some designs are meant to be put into slides. For more interactability, got to my [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/brief.look).

One day, a man walked into a bar. Inside, he sat on the bar stool and ordered a glass full of Brandy. One must have thought that this man rushed his way and took a quick swig at the glass full of Brandy. In fact, the contrary happened. For all we know, the bar is a place to drown away the sorrow, but this man did not want to drown his just yet. Yes, of course, the man came with all of his sorrow, but he's a man of sense. While sitting down, his eyes were fixed on the glass of Brandy. Premonitions came to mind, all of it - hungover, robbed, and waking up late. The man of sense - let's call him that, finally raised his glass and slowly put the rim against his lips. It was slow at first, but that pungent taste of Brandy was to be a friend of his after drops went to stream. "I must be sensible! There is just no way I am going to be late tomorrow. Moreover, without my wallet in my pocket!", thought the man wearily. What a man, he sure has his own ups and downs, but he is a man of great sense after all!


Ladies and gentlemen, no doubt about it - The Sensible Man. His feature of sensibility is that of early philosophers: logic. Behind all of his action, there need to be a systematical reasoning behind it.

The sensible man, yes he is, decided to partake in another glass of Brandy, and this time it was not full. After a long consideration and reasoning (which is a story in and of itself), he decided that it would be best to venture with the half glass of Brandy. Thereafter, there was a quick swig; a little premonition. It was truly a contrast to what he had done before, but nonetheless, he is a sensible man. "Tell me, what is your job?" said the sensible man vehemently to the bartender, "You see," said the bartender didactically, "I deal things... at night.", "At night?" asked the sensible man with a hint of skepticism. His stupid and ignorant face gradually changes to suspicion, starting with the frowning of his eyebrows. "Hey... Wait a minute, I know you!" said the sensible man with a suspicious tone, "Ah, I see. You're still sensibl-" the bartender was instantly cut short by the sensible man, "You are a DRUG DEALER!" said the sensible man, "Yes, I'm a- I'm a what!? No! I'm not a drug dealer!". That short and innocent exchange about one's occupation has turned into collective suspicions. Those weary, red eyes and noses were instantly fixed on those two men. The bartender, with a clean martini glass that he was cleaning, stopped and looked around the room slowly... "Hey! What's the big idea, huh? This man in front of me, asked about my job. I told him that I am a-", "You worked at night and dealt things to people!", the bartender was aghast. Consequently, the room turned into whispers and murmurs. If we accumulate each and every word, the word DRUG DEALER is the most prominent between those whispers.

The situation has gotten worse - the whispers haven't stopped for a long time now. It has gotten so bad that the whole place looks like it was a church! Thousands of drunkards gathered around in a circle, and in the middle - the sensible man... Like an apostle, his words were heard by many. The sensible man meticulously formed his words and ended every sentence with ", cheers to that" by raising a pint of beer and drinking it straight. As for the bartender? He has gotten accustomed to it by now; at least he thought... For we all know, death is inevitable in the great ol’ story of religion. Suddenly, the age-old tradition that we call “Lynching”, was downed upon the bartender. “Must we deal with all of this bullshit?” preach the sensible man, “Wicked and crooked people roam the street, giving drugs to our kids.. Are we just going to stand here!?”, the sudden and collective voices shouted, “NO! WE WON’T!”. Now, it is down to him that the situation is not to be taken lightly. While the crowds were distracted by all of the commotions, the bartender tried to sneak his way outside, wanting to call the security; a big man of African American descent. “and therefore, we need to protect the children! Ehm- one more pint please”, no response. The sensible man looked up “Can you plea-”, he was shocked to find that there was nobody behind the bar. Angry and agitated he looks around to find him. “There he is! He’s making a run for it. GET HIM!” the whole crew of drunkards started to chase after the bartender. The bartender ran for his life, gasping for air and suddenly becoming a trained athlete. Looking back, the bartender had imagined the running drunkards as a group of heathen Scandinavian Vikings – chasing after him, a Danish monk. They were running and tackling the tables and chairs like a craze religious maniac. Right there, you’re so close, mister bartender! But it was too bad, he’d stumbled right before the door that leads outside with the African American man. They grabbed his leg: “Burned the goddamn devil!”, “Gentleman, gentleman! It’s alright, I’m no devil,” but of course, they won’t listen. After almost emptying his pockets of lexical, the bartender then said “Tonight, and only for tonight. You will, you all will get a free drink all night! I mean it! ”, the loudness became deafeningly silent. “Now, let me go. How can I serve you these fine liquors?”, they discussed to each other for a while and agreed upon letting go of the Danish monk. “Thank you, gentleman,” said the bartender, “Now if you may, you can go back to your place. I will approach you one by one, and I’ll take your order”. Thereafter, everyone is seated like kids from kindergarten. “All right, folks! Here I come, I’ll start with this man – the sensible man”, as he lifted his left foot, making a notion that he would move forward to approach him. But as soon as he put his foot down, he did this cartoony 180 degrees turn towards the door, and ran for it. Finally, he locked the door from the outside. Confused, the security then asked the bartender about what just happened. “For the love of any race – including you – do not open that god-forsaken door!”, instructs the bartender “Now, you wait here. I’ll go to the nearest police station, alright?”, “Yes, sir,” replied the security. The bartender hurriedly went to the police station. The security, peering inside the circular window in the front door – saw a very diligent-looking man lying wasted on the wooden floor. “A suit and slick-back hair. What’s a sensible-looking man like him doing at a place like this?” said the security while shaking his head...

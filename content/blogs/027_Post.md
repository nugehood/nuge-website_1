People, writers, often go outside to write. Most of them prefer to do so because it offers a place for them to solely — and vehemently, focus on their writing. Surprisingly, in this day and age, people have started to find alternatives to keep themselves busy without the option of going places; physically.

Not only writers, people occasionally find streaming as a place for doing any kind of productivity; drawing, painting, etc. It’s very flexible. You can live stream on almost every mainstream social media, such as (1) Instagram, (2) Meta, (3) TikTok, (4) YouTube, and of course, (5) Twitch. But I guess streaming is not really for everyone. Most writers — I assumed — like to be in an open space with natural lighting and the frequent breeze from the wind. Relatively speaking, you can stream everywhere, right? As long as you have an active internet. Stream everywhere, at a café, library, or park.

This is not a new thing. There are tons of live streams and videos in the category of Study with Me. It’s a genre of video that captures people working on something, sometimes accompanied by additional background noise, to help you stay in the line of productivity; and imagine yourself studying together with these people. These videos gain a lot of popularity, with one video having 14 Million Views!

## Why Stream Your Writing Process?
I argued about how streaming is like going out to a café — and keeping yourself busy. Incidentally, writers might find streaming to also be distracting. For most, it’s like being watched by a teacher when doing an exam; meaning that you need to focus on your writing. For some, it’s like being anxiously watched by random people and having the need to converse and engage these viewers; removing themselves from the initial goal…

I am aware of how people have different ways of approaching things when it comes to productivity — but, there are benefits to streaming that you might find useful. Firstly, as a writer, growing an audience is a must. I have had stories about how networking is one of the most essential things to have when you are serious about publishing your work. Connecting to different authors and sharing tidbits about your writing. Streaming is one of the steps for PERSONALLY connecting to your readers. My advice is to stream your writing activity on Instagram. Why? Because almost all people across the globe, use Instagram. Moreover, content-wise, you can post many things there to initially grow and then connect more with streaming. Lastly, you can monetize the stream. In accordance with Instagram, you can use their Badge feature to do so. Badges are like currencies; each one having different values.

## To Conclude
We have learned that, to be a writer — especially those who want to grow their audience — you need to have a platform to connect to them. The idea of streaming your writing process onto the internet will help you to stay on track; and finish whatever goal you just started. Additionally, you will gain a little bit of money from doing it (if the platform allows you to do so).

Just like I said, productivity tips are double-edged swords. Beyond streaming, writers can also conduct an online video conference between friends or other writers — to have the same effect as writing in a Café. Although it doesn’t have any kind of benefits that I’d just mentioned, nonetheless, it’s still viable.

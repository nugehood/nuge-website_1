Earth is such a gigantic place. Some marvel at its vast sight of cultures, traditions, tribes, cities, and fishes. Although grandeur in appearance and diverse in content, most people have spent their entire lives within a particular place — a village or city.

It's a choice; to move around or not. Either way, we'll find something to write about (only if we have the required amount of vocabulary needed). Some writers have argued that you need to travel and experience life so you can have something interesting to write about. Even though they didn't say it exactly like that, Charles Bukowski and Ernest Hemingway would've agreed with it.

For the knowledge of writers who argued against them — I have none. But, I am a writer, right? I write. I am a writer and I live in Borneo, yes, that weirdly shaped island in Indonesia. It is a big place — but yet, I don't have the motivation to explore it. And I don't think you need to go places so you can write. It is only a requirement if your writing demands some kind of research in that particular place.

Whatever they are, that kept me from it, is not important. I can point my finger directly at assignments from college and so on, but before that, there was no motivation at all!

My point is that, there is a lot to explore, write, and talk about when it comes to a place. Sitting in your bedroom might feel mundane and boring, but stop for a while and look around. Right there and on, what did you see, how was the weather, why did you place things there, why did you have that thing, why is your room so clean/dirty, what are some moments that can be found in this place, so on and so on.

See? Looking at things in our room can be easily done momentarily, hence why it's tasteless and boring. But when it comes to contemplating them, you will find yourself with sparks and chains upon chains of stuff to write.

That is why I've created this kind of challenge or series about where you're currently writing and what kind of thoughts or observations you made while being there. I am pretty sure there exists a similar challenge like this, meaning that I am not the inventor of this so-called "challenge". I call it: 



> **What I write when _______ on/in _________.**

For example:
1. [What I write when sitting on a metallic bench on the campus](https://factorygarden.bearblog.dev/what-i-write-when-sitting-on-a-metallic-bench-on-the-campus/)
2. What I write when standing on a wooden floor in the library
3. etc.

Don't worry about running out of ideas — and, especially, don't worry about not being able to write just because you can't go somewhere physically. You can still do it!

> **Keep on writing and blogging <3**

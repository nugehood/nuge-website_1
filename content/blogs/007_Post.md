> ***To expand, one needs to appreciate all walks of existence.***

I guess we are not far from what we were before, at least I'm not. Growing up for us has got to be the most important and impactful phase in our life. See how many books, music, and film talks about these subjects? Tons of them! So, it must be impactful, and I beg to differ if someone says otherwise.

We grew up with and filled with souls and spirits. Amongst those who are most profound to us have got to be our parents, relatives, and or friends. For those children whose life was full of people and playgrounds, they must be lucky, even luckier than the one across the river - the artist.

People tried to delve into the mind of the artist, why has it got a lot of "creativity" and ideas that precede the "normal" human? Well, the tale goes like this: The artist, has got no one around, and thus they created someone out of something. They are among those who we called, people who practice **Animism**. The artist, might look a slight bit uncaring, and selfish at times, but look again. The artist respected all walks of life, and by their standard and definition, it means all things that existed.

One specific object that many of these artists chose is **cinema**. The artist, struggle with their minds, frustrated with the world, they, want to create realities that their mind created. It's only fair for us humans to pour some piece of mind into the world. They, me, chose this way.

A few paragraphs ago I wrote about how growing up has got to be the most important phase in our life, and I have the same position as when I asked about it. I think you already know where this is going... Movies! That glamorous and structured visual trip! I grew up with that peculiar and exciting object for the rest of my life, and I am here for years to come! English, poetry, happiness, sadness, and many more, are implicated to me at a young age. The complexity of a movie is enough to penetrate a young child's fragile eggshell mind. The English language itself, I'd learned from watching movies with subtitles, was very impactful. The movie challenges me with the director's (another word for artist), ideologies. Even though the movie that they were and are making is an adaptation from another media, it has got to be an element of the director's ideological choices. Camera positions, movements, and transitions.

Like little children, we giggled our way through this media. We are accompanied by, of course, our cameras, microphones, lighting, actors, editors, and cups of coffee. Our eyes started to form black holes, a vision that was supposed to be looking out, instead, it's now looking in. We've turned our eyes to our brain, and mind multiple times and it is somewhat hard to turn it around. Sometimes, we exploited this ability and made it our escape mechanism.

Artists are the most profound individuals in the world. The thinker? They too, no more, no less. How many times did a word correlate to a thinker? Maybe ***Freudian***... There are so many ***eponymous adjectives*** that borrow the name of artists. Check out lists of [**Artfully Eponymous Adjectives here!**](https://www.wordnik.com/lists/eponymous-adjectives--1#)

Have I been going on for too long? Stretching this page? Making you bored? I hope yes and no because you've made it this far. But really, cinema and film played an important role in my life growing up, it teaches me English, matured me as an individual, and let me explore the deep, without **nurturing** and **reassuring** - ***full frontal exposure of someone's mind.*** But above all, it thought me that, long pauses, and silence, are okay...

>*Cinema, to you I owe my life. I've seen life outside of the screen, inside. Languages and colors could be found, as you said, not in the literal meaning of its word. This endeavor is a long one, for you, out there, whoms't disrespected by people. You don't demand any respect, you just want to do what you want. Sometimes, respect is what it took to start this revolution. You've tried to prove, with slits, blood, sweat, and tears, they've looked, but nothing beyond that... This is for a short time reassuring but, just remember, there are many of you outside, and we loved to share the same feeling.*

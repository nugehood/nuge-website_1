What did you usually do in your **free time**? In the modern world maybe you are stuck with your smartphone and their wide range of **parasocial activities** - feeding into your or their sense of narcissim. In a pretty hefty and constantly ever changing world, it can get a lot. When it gets a lot, people will try and find a way, knowingly or not, to built their own escape mechanism. Oh, how badly mannered I am, I should've started with the reason I wrote this article, and not only it'll make me look good, it'll also clear out this putrid smells.

Just like the usual, I am sitting outside with my laptop in my lap, music from **Raymond Scott**, and a cup of **coffee**. The coffee tasted a little bit different than how it was, and so I thought. Could it be that this is the right taste? Usually it was really not this sour. I just took another sip, and now it seems like they're balance in taste. Everyday, the coffee that closest and dear to my heart has got to be Kopi Tubruk. It is a way of making a coffee in **Indonesia**, and it supposed to be influenced or carried here by the middle-eastern merchants. I don't know much (in detail), about the history of coffee in Indonesia, but I know one thing, that is we didn't have access to luxurious machinery like the **espresso machine**. Thus, we were pretty grateful, hopefully, by the influences from the middle-eastern merchants.

After that little **discourse** on coffee, let's find out about what I am writing about, and why I wrote it?

These are though times for us. We have to find a way to keep our mental in check and analyze the **perpetrator** who distrubs it. It's a simple case of **cognitive dissonance**, we want to be productive and enjoy things, but we often do things that were counterproductive with our beliefs. I've read something about how human couldn't live without productivity, goals, to attain something. I must've read about it first in a book called "**Marx & Freud**", it is a book about *Marxisme* and *Psychoanalysis*. The same idea then occured when I read "**Industrial Society and Its Future**", specifically in the *Power Process* section. Productivity then, must be important to us, and as a human being, we would look into what we are doing carefully and analyze their values, consequently, creating a **dilemma**.

Why am I doing this? I should've been doing something better than this. This question usually took place when the individual was doing an act, that was very dehumanizing for them, like scrolling **endlessly** on social media. What do we achieve in social media platforms? Essentially we use these platform to know the status and the condition of those closest to us, relatives, friends, and family. But, what if we're out of information to those closest to us? Well... We'll find something to **care** about, or rather **crave** about. This endless craving of information, random facts, laugther, and many more, is one of the many cases of how social media could lead to a **destructive behaviour**. When the said content was found, we got a hit of **dopamine**, and we crave for more of it, and I mean why not? We have the tools, the access? That's true, but what about the consequences of this action? Short attention span, lost of focus, and possibly, **sociopathic** behaviours. Worst yet, it'll yield some kind of **pathological** phenomenon.

Choosing the right thing to do, the good dopamine. ***Writing***. That's what I want to talk about in the first place. On why writing away and pouring your thoughts into writing is a good thing than spending your **mental** power on social media. Maybe you'll ask, "But we can also write something on social media". That will be correct, but you're missing a point here. Social media **tempts** you, to do something rather than that. Sure you could write something, but what else could you do? Getting hammered by so many content at the same time. So my advice: Build you own *blog*, *place*, or *homepage* for you specifically, to **WRITE**. We all know focus is something important, for me it goes like this: I couldn't work when I am in the bedroom, even though there's a place for me to write, the main purpose of a bedroom is to rest. So I would rather go someplace for doing work. The point is that, you will not be expecting to do writing, when you're not in a place for writing.

Writing is very **therapeutic** and **relaxing**, and you'll find it **satisfying** how thinking could easily be put to a writing - each characters slowly building a paragraph. I am simply writing this to write, and for you to write. I must warn you, just like reading a book, writing can be addicting to some people, and I think, for those who spent their times on social media, will finally find writing to be something enchanting.

Last but not least, and to conclude:
> *Writing is art. It's everything you could think of! One thing for sure: I am sad because I could not add anymore to this paragraph. **End of thought...***

> **On top of the cliff - meekly; gently, I pushed myself towards the edge, unto my untimely death...**

The struggle of life is a great one, and living for that purpose is a necessity. We want to remove ourselves from problems - yet, our greatest trope is creating them. Consequently, this, created problem for us. Call it a paradox or something, and there are only two ways to rid of it; sheer ignorance and death. I’ll explain about the former. Sheer ignorance is known to be the common way for us human to keep on living. It is a kind of living that can only be described as tunnel visioning - ignoring every aspect of life as a mean to live. If the horrifying images on this earth were to vanish, then people can live easily. Yet, people still ignore those images and keep living. Realistically speaking, those images exist. The masses completely ignore them. They mention the images, but what about action? For the latter, well… It COMPLETELY explains itself.

In all seriousness, this is a story; a demonstration of the two procedures. It is a chaotic - or fittingly, Quixotic story.

## 1. How much for a name?

---

He is a man; 30-year of age; thin body; with an archaic posture of a working man. 5 o’clock in the morning - whilst waiting for the rising sun - he awaits the Sunny-Side Up in the deli across the street. On top of the roof, he carefully opens the red tin box which, to our surprise, contains a couple of bucks; and a picture of a fine lady under the top side.

Meow! The man quickly closes his red tin box and turns; ding! The sound of the bell across the street presents itself with a sign that says “OPEN” on the window of the deli. He rushes down the wooden ladder, conveniently placed at the front of his house. Nothing needs fixing, only serving his morning routine. We see the man walking across the street, giving minuscule notion of greetings towards his neighbour. The damp aroma of the street - presumably from the midnight rain - turned into that of a middle-eastern bazaar; sweet and spicy. Sure ’nuff, because the guy that owns the deli is an Arab. “Good morning, Mister Irving,” said the Arab, “Mornin’! How do you do Mehmet?” replied Irving. “Yes, I am good - oh, and by the way-” Mehmet realizes something and goes to the back to take something. Irving waits, - not a long wait, unlike those of a Monday morning’s flag ceremony - and Mehmet comes out with his long-awaited 6 o’clock breakfast. On the plate: Sunny-Side Up with hints of pepper, a side of bacon, and chops of potato - approximately sliced into 3 parts. Is it a depressing breakfast for you? Yes? Well, Mehmet - God bless his soul - is able to create collections of food that you deem to be depressing; into something uplifting.

Irving slowly carries the plate into that lonely spot in the corner: a table and a wooden chair. It is the only spot in the deli where you can sit and enjoy the meal; people usually buy something from the deli and then cook the rest at home. This lonely spot is a perfect spot. It is located in the corner, near the deli’s window. This, of course, is a part of Irving’s morning routine. He puts the plate on the table gently and continues to sit. He stretches his feet; cracks his knuckles; and rubs his hands. A ritual. Firstly, he takes the spoon with his right and; the fork with his left. Just when he’s about to stab that golden potato; a clink. His coffee - pitch black - is now ready. He puts down the utensils and walks to the counter. From his vision, we can see steam rising from the coffee. He handles it with care, but some spills on the counter. “Sorry…” Mehmet, in a white apron, cleaned the spillage with a circular motion. Finally, it is complete: Irving’s iconic 6 o’clock breakfast! With the courtesy of Mehmet of course…

## 2. Employed

Like a gas-filled Moped, Irving went off to work. The city is not a very interesting place to be - thus, the story of Irving’s journey to his workplace is not the point of interest. Just a bunch of ol’, grey, and mossy buildings. However, one building in particular - this one happened to be Irving’s workplace - is going to be the topic of our interest. Irving works at a lumber factory; 2-mile from his house. Irving’s job is to help with the Bandsaw mahchine. Putting aside the already split lumber into the correct pile. It is perhaps the only ever existing lumber factory in the area; so most of the employees are Irving’s neighbours. Before putting on actual work, the employees need to do the ol’ punching in ’n’ out on the clock machine - look! There he is! Just in time! Irving is walking towards the factory with both of his hands tucked inside his pockets; foot up; head down. First, in what appears to be a white phone booth, Irving greets Mister Vliet; the security guard. It’s hard to describe what Mister Vliet looks like, and I will count on your perception of a bulbous Russian taxi driver. The gate was already opened. And our precious hero proceeded to take his boots off; for another set of ‘specialized’ working boots.

By the entrance - a door; Frederic & Co Inc. Opening the door, we can see a long hallway separating us from the abundance of machinery beyond the door in the distance. The hallway is long. A man could contemplate his entire life. As Irving moves towards the door, the sound of murmurs outside gradually changes to an industrial haven: CLINK; CLANK; WHER WHER WHER. Just before the door - on the left - a punching clock; and rows of employee cards. Irving takes his; on the third row; and the fourth from the left. He inserts the card into the slot, pulls the leaver down, and it is instantly followed by a DING! He puts back the card. He takes another card beside him that has "Jimmy" written on it. His eyes dart around the hallway for any kind of presence; but nothing. Irving continues to put the card into the slot and ding!

Irving walks to his locker and changes his attire. He removes his clothes and puts on the homemade sleeveless shirt and safety goggles — a footstep. Irving looks in the direction of the footstep; putting his goggles up. It is a rather thin-looking man with a black suit and a red tie. This character is a stranger to us. Irving and his co-worker have known this man as “Mister Frederic”. Yes, from that poorly written name on the glass pane of the entrance door. He continues towards the creaky wooden stairs; creak-creak, and then ascends into his office. Back to his senses, Irving picks up a pair of gloves and wears them. Two large trucks come in carrying logs in their trunks. These logs then going to undergo a series of processes which turn them into lumber. For each process, there will be a new machine put to use. For example, there is a machine used for debarking the log; a band saw to cut small edges of the log's profile, and so on...

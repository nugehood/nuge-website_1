[Link to the poem](/blogs/032_post)

I've been thinking a lot about works of literature from my areaâ€”**Banjarmasin**. Banjarese people and its language are so unique that it took me quite a while to notice them, since it's a part of my identity and blood. There are tons of cultures and traditions here. My favorites are its musical instruments, dances, and pieces of literature.

The desire to create a piece of literature in my language was immense (and still is). Therefore, I landed upon Poetry as my starting point. I searched the internet for Banjarese poems but seldom were found. From then on, without any prior knowledge about poetry using the Banjarese language, the best thing to do for me was start creating. And that's exactly what I did.

**Urang nang apa?** or roughly translated to English: "*What kind of person?*" was an attempt to interpret an experience with Banjarese people, prejudices, substance abuse, and lack of mental-health awareness. The most prominent theme is blue-collar jobs, specifically in Bahasa Indonesia: "Buruh kayu", people who work in a lumber factory and the despair that accompanies them.

## 1. Introduction
---
It's the year 2023 and you seriously doesn't have your own personal hompage or blog? Are you still depended on using **Facebook**, **Instagram**, **Twitter**, **Linkedin** & the infamous **threads** to act as your "blog"? It's time to change that behaviour of yours for the better.

You see, these centralized platform have been in some sort of a bad publicity. Twitter is having a limit on how many tweet a user can read for a day, and in return for increasing the number, you need to pay for their monthly subscription of **Twitter Blue**. Now **Meta** is trying their hardest to be the saviour for the **microblogging** platform by offering their brand new platform called **Threads**, which in itself, still have many problems.

So how do we counteract this opression by the **big-tech**? Well, by creating your own hompage or blog. Having full control of your website is so much more theraputic because of the full freedom that it offers, and you don't even have to worry about sudden changes of the platform by those centralized social media. You'll decide what to do and what to change. Having your own website in this day of age (that's if you're active in the digital world), is considered like having your own home. Do you want your own home with pre-built security camera controlled by others, or do you want it built by youself without these secruity breaching features? I think it's obvious that you would want to seek the latter.

## 2. Blog is Outdated?
---
In my personal opinion, they are not. Sure it has its share of downs. But now they're gaining traction again like how they used to, why? Because of all these news about the mainstream social media platform being incompetent and annoying.

Blog is a personal hompage/website in which its user can post their writing and information about their self, without any limitations. I'm looking at you **Twitter**... In the blog, people share their thougts about certain topics and how they're doing. Blogging is less addicting, and it's so much more productive in my opinion, because it urges the user to write a coherent and comprehensive piece, unlike **Twitter** & **Instagram** who offer little to no freedom in terms of how many words or picture could be put into one post, you are restricted on how you can present or express yourself. Others can usually give out their thoughts about your writing in your blog, that's if you provided or enabled comment in each article.

In conclusion, no. They are not outdated. Blogs are pretty much used to express one's self in a more presentable way according to its user. People wouldn't want to have that freedom taken away from them and being dependant to something they don't have any control over. It might take a while for people to recover from the mainstream platform, since building your own personal blog seems like it requires a hefty workloads, but rest assure, there are 2 options for building your own personal blog/hompage.

## 3. D.I.Y Blog

Making your own blog is almost like making a website, because it is. But it could be a hassle for someone who just want to write and doesn't want to code (I highly suggest you to learn one programming language). That's why I will give you three options to build your blog from absolute beginner to advanced.

1. [**Blogger**](https://www.blogger.com/about/?hl=id)
2. [**WordPress**](https://wordpress.com/)
3. [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/)

I recommend you using **Hugo** since it allows you more freedom than the first 2. For how to build website with **Hugo** you'll have to wait for me to write it, or you can find out how to [**quick start**](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).

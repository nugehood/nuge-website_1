## The Struggle
---
So, I've been searching for the right "Distraction-free" writing software. When I opened the software, the first thing I need to see should be a blank white or grey canvas. On the account of having toolbar or menu, I am all up for it. But it needs to follow these rule: (1) you can hide it when you don't need it, and it should have the essentials (**bold**, *italic*, and header). I assumed it was an easy task to do, right? No, I've searched everywhere, through YouTube and forum — I'd found none!

List of softwares that I found was just horrendous. I can't even considered most of them to be "Distraction-free". Even though there are some that fulfill a certain rule that I had — most of them comes with compensatiton. For example, you need to pay a MONTHLY FEE for using them. I mean, that is just crazy! It's a piece of software that worked like notepad; but, slightly modified in terms of their aesthetic.

**WHY CAN'T IT BE FREE?**

## Enter WritePlus
---
Let me tell you about my encounter with WritePlus. So, I was desperate — yet again — to find a “Distraction-free” software. And I’ve been using Notepad++ to write my short story — using a text/code editor is not really optimal and efficient for me. Even though I was able to write like a thousand words in total. I was desperate… That is until I searched for it again and got redirected to the Microsoft Store. I’ve avoided Microsoft Store for a long time, that’s because I thought it was just another Epic Games scenario — but I was mistaken. That’s because all of the best software, unironically, could be found there. One of them is WritePlus.

### What is WritePlus
---
WritePlus is essentially a "glorified" notepad for people who like to write. Once you opened the software, it will opens in fullscreen mode; depriving you from any kind of distractions. However, it's not entirely blank. On top of the screen you'll see a toolbar. That's okay, because they're used to play around with texts; emphasizing them. Furthermore, you have the freedom of minimizing the menu. Now, you have achieved a state of **ZEN**. Talking about zen, you can turn on the Deep Focus mode. **Deep Focus** will highlight the line that you're currently on, and fading the rest — as to keep you focus on that line.

Not only that, there's also an additional menu so you can change the theme, width of the document, and weight of the font. Moreover, they also have premium version that offers:

- Exporting document to PDF, Word, WAVE, and HTML
- Text to Speech
- Word Cloud
- Word Count
- More Themes
- No watermark in the printout

Most of these are easily achieveable by copy-pasting it into a word-processor like ***LibreWriter*** and then exporting it into PDF. Initially, you'll have 3 themes to choose from. And this is where things took turn for the worst, — for some people — you have to pay for **Dark Mode**. I'm fine with **Light Mode**, but some people will cry for that feature.

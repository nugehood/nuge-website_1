<p style="text-align: center;">

The city was once a village
<br>
The village was green and small
<br>
Everyone agreed that nature was friend
<br>
And to forget means to let it die
<br>
Nature is large
<br>
Nature is larger than life
<br>
All of these statements are misleading
<br>
For nature cannot be measured
<br>
And its existence is life itself
<br>
<br>
Nature puts  its suit and visit its people in many ways
<br>
Most of its visit were recounted by writers who lived in a village
<br>
One man wrote: "In the middle of the field I was carresed by the gentle wind. It did not bothered me, it reassured me"
<br>
A woman, who had an experience with the weather wrote: "The sun was shining down on us. The gentle warmth bring the people out to play"
<br>
<br>
The city emerges from nowehere
<br>
And it demands its people to walk faster towards death
<br>
The village and it houses decayed
<br>
Went and gone
<br>
Most of them turns to dirt and soil
<br>
<br>
Nature leaves
<br>
Its goodbye was the last green leaf
<br>
<br>
Since every building in the city needs premit to visit
<br>
It went to search for villages
<br>
<br>
The city is full of life
<br>
People lived
<br>
Nature is gone
<br>
But what of it?
<br>
Writers still recount their life
<br>
<br>
O, the writer...
<br>
Bless their souls
<br>
For every experience is a writing
<br>
And every experience is sometime
<br>
Not worth living
<br>
But, writing indicates that they were alive
<br>
<br>
See the sky
<br>
Seldom could you see the sun
<br>
And if it does
<br>
It brings great pain to its people
<br>
Seldom could you see the star
<br>
And if it does
<br>
It brings them hope for a future that cannot be achieved
<br>
<br>
A businessman wrote: "I awoke with great pain on my back. Everything here is always at large, everything. Buildings, pollutions, and the color grey"
<br>
The writer doesn't find it necessary to put another story
<br>
For it was surprisingly
<br>
The same story
<br>
Told over and over again
<br>
<br>
No sunshine could warm its people
<br>
No wind could caress its worries
<br>
And no green to bring virtue and beauty
<br>
<br>
Let us all sing a song of silence
<br>
For it seems like another tree was tumbled
<br>
Another field was burnt.

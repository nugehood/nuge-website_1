It doesn't even matter where you are. You can exist on a different universe, earth, planet, and plane of existence, altogether. By mere chance — and nature's will — we will always find each other in similar ways. I, the helpless being — and you, the refuge; made for each other, can't live without one another. You are the star that shines the brightest; the stream of water that flows quietly, the lullaby that lulls slowly, and whose hand, touched me, gently.

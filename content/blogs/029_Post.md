Yes, that's right — I have a new blog. However, this page will still be maintained. And it will serve as my landing page. So, what about this new blog? Well, this new blog will have weekly posts, and it is called [**"Factory Garden"**](https://factorygarden.bearblog.dev/) — nice place for me to put out writings that are not too long and well thought out. In addition, the blog is VERY minimalistic, and I encourage you to check it out! You can even build one yourself here. On the contrary, this page will still contain writings, but they'll be longer and more thought out by comparison.

<p style="text-align: center;">
Ah, yes, professor, doctor, Ph.D., bachelor of every degree
<br>
You are the god's instrument manifest!
<br>
You will decide what is right and what is wrong
<br>
My ideas are not my ideas
<br>
My thoughts are clearly not mine
<br>
My writings are not written by my hand
<br>
There is no need for an elaborate proof
<br>
You are the expert
<br>
God's own instrument
<br>
<br>
All of the days gone
<br>
Years past
<br>
and old age start
<br>
How does it feel?
<br>
Do you see us
<br>
the younglings
<br>
as threats?
<br>
Or was it vice versa
<br>
oh, dear expert?
<br>
<br>
We worshipped you, oh dear bachelor of every degree!
<br>
We gave you money
<br>
We let you live
<br>
Just so you can tell us the rights and wrongs of life
<br>
You oppressed us and manipulated us
<br>
You are very naughty, aren't you?
<br>
<br>
You give kind words
<br>
Just to then
<br>
Shut us down with your experties
<br>
<br>
Well, this writing is wrong
<br>
My lines of thoughts are not mine
<br>
Moreover, I don't exist
<br>
And you still get paid
</p>

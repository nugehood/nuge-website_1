I believe the activity of writing to be an introverted one. Thereby, you need to absolutely manifest whatever it is in your unconscious mind into the stream of consciousness, which results in a series of words. Well, people can also argue that every kind of activity that requires focus needs focus — wow! So, I am saying the obvious? Not really.

I am writing on the account of this book by Guy Claxton: [Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind](tab:https://www.amazon.com/Hare-Brain-Tortoise-Mind-Intelligence/dp/0060955414). To put a little of the writing into my own words: The creative process is contemplation. What is truly defined as a product of good writing beyond linguistics is unbeknownst to me. Sentences can be structured accordingly with grammatical features to create cohesion and flow; but what about ideas?

I believe to have limitations with the English language—since it is considered to be a foreign language in my country—my ideas though, can be imagined without the constraint of a language. 

> **Ideas are a bunch of experiences. Imaginations are a bunch of experiences modified by possibilities.**

I might be a little bit idealistic. But I believe that we need to get and be in the presence of solitude. Without it, how can you write while your mind is disturbed?

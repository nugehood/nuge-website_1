This is not a new blog or website, and I'm still using the same domain as the previous one. The old layout in my opinion looked fine, it was minimalistic, but it was not that responsive (mainly because I played too much with the **CSS**).

The reason as to why I change to this new layout is solely because I want it to be responsive, formal, and minimalistic. And that's why I use [**PaperMod**](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) theme for Hugo. It is easily customizable and offers extensive features.

So, what's to expect from this new look? Nothing! It will be the same as ever. The website will function as a **landing page** and a **blog** about my writing.

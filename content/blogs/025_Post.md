What do you get from talking too much? When you're eating too much, you will get fat. When you're walking too much, you will get tired. So, what about talking too much? I mean, of course, you are going to get tired. However, what kind of effect does it have on you? Walking too much will tire you, but the result is, you're going to be more healthy. What about talking too much? You talk too much, you will get tired, and...? Well, I can hear you yelling, "You will either get smarter or dumber!". Hahaha, you're right. I mean, as the writer, that's what I thought! Kind of meta, huh? Essentially, the purpose of talking is to communicate. Communication happens between two people or more. Let's clear that out of the way. Talking to yourself as a means of communication is not very effective. Why? Because, when you're talking to yourself, your thought process will only be limited to your words. So, if you're working on something whilst talking (**e.g. reading, working**), your thought process will be hindered.

How about in the activity of language learning, especially speaking? Well, I stand corrected. Although, I talk to myself very often, ‚Äî because I don't have any friends ‚Äî the outcome is still the same, it is not very effective to build speaking skills by talking to yourself. Again, when it comes to speaking skills, it is necessary for you to improve by having a **two-way communication** with someone, on the account that language skills require naturalness. Do not constrain yourself, try to talk, write, read, and speak without any hindrance.

Therefore, it is as clear as day: Talking is a two-way communication. There should be another person listening and or responding to each other's speech. The question is still there though: Talking too much = bad? All I've proved in the previous paragraphs was just talking to yourself = bad. I've forgotten that talking to yourself **TOO MUCH** = bad. There you go. How about talking too much in a conversation?

Let's clarify some things. Firstly, talking too much in a conversation without giving a chance for others to talk is always going to be in bad taste. So, that's out of the way. Talking too much here is the activity of having a conversation. 

* üëç Talking too much **‚â†** Talking over other people.
* üëé Talking too much **=** The activity of conversation. 
 
Got it? **Great!**

I believe that conversations are split into two categories:
* üß† Meaningful conversation
* üóø and unmeaningful conversation

Now, like every statement ever ‚Äî I need to clarify and make it as clear-cut as possible. Some might argue that unmeaningful conversation = meaningful conversation. Because the meaning of its conversation is the unmeaningfulness of it. It's an absurd way of looking at things. In that case, everything has meaning. Although it is a bit mistaken, meaningful conversation here leads to the outcome of the conversation itself. Whether there's any subsequent substance to the conversation. Therefore, unmeaningful is the contrasting idea of meaningful conversation.

Alright, how bout the initial question? So, to justify whether too much talking is good or bad, it can be measured through its substance. To put it into a sentence: Talk too much with substance you'll get smarter. Talk too much with little to no substance you'll get dumber. Thank you‚Ä¶

This will be a short writing, it is more of a statement.

People need to realize that, if you truly want to know someone, their personality and such, it's very bad to do it if you're using **Instagram**, **Twitter** or **Facebook**, not bad, faulty. The whole idea of finding someone that you want to be friend with or hired, is to know them. Sure **Twitter** and **Facebook** offers writing, a blog-like writing, they called them **Microblogging**, a platform in which its content revolves on short or byte-size contents.

Not that's just stupid, why do we have to limit certain aspect of our writing? **Tumblr**, I assumed, tried the blog approach, good, but there's still a room for improvement. People need to realized that relying solely on a platform owned and run by a company could be dangerous, look at the state of **Twitter** right now. Soon all of your hardwork will be gone in an instant, as soon as the company went bankrupt.

That's why having your own freedom to customize and express yourself is a great concept of what a "**Social Media**" truly is. It should feel like visiting someone else's home.

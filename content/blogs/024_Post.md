Solitude is a womb. A place of beginning. There's no end to solitude. A place where a man can have the liberty to express themselves. There, they can use their body and mind without any hesitation. Best of all, a place of no being. It reminds us of the ether, where everything is self; and no separation of beings. We hate and dislike another human being because we cannot see ourselves in them. We reserve to the idea of calling them “Mad” and “Crazy”. Very ironic, because the one that cannot comprehend them, is the one that calls them “Crazy”.

Solitude, where you can scream without yielding a sound. Solitude, where you can cry without shedding a tear. Solitude, where you can be without somebody.

Being alone is solitude — no, loneliness is not solitude… Do not fred yourself with being alone. Be fred of loneliness. Loneliness is not the self. Loneliness is a cancer that slowly eats your being. Do not let yourself be lonely. Do not fred the company of others, for they are the cure of all loneliness. Do not isolate. If you are lost, find those who feel the same. Find them. Do not fred, for there are chances. Do not give up. Please, find them. It does not matter — I am sure, you will stumble upon one and another.

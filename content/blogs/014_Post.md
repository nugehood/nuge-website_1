<p style="text-align: center;">
I took a deep breath
<br>
As I awoke from a lethargic sleep
<br>
My senses are still at youth
<br>
As the morning sun creeps
<br>
<br>
My candle burned in each step
<br>
Every warmth it gave
<br>
declined
<br>
Every chill they gave
<br>
inclined
<br>
<br>
Whatever happened to the warmth?
<br>
I try hugging myself
<br>
It resulted in no such warmth...
<br>
The hug suddenly turns into chill
<br>
Everything feel so still
<br>
My face is cold
<br>
From the tears
